From the IBM Data Engineering Certificate class:

It was a bit of an accident that I enrolled in this project.  I had intended to be enrolled in the Data Science specialization which is much more comprehensive, but was instead enrolled in the data engineering specialization.  Oddly enough, their 'project' classes are slightly different material even though they utilize basically the same Python.
