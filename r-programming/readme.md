# R Programming
There's a lot of stuff in here.  The [Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) program by Johns Hopkins on Coursera is an R based program that includes the following classes:

- *The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox
- *R Programming
- *Getting and Cleaning Data
- *Exploratory Data Analysis
- Reproducible Research

The Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization adds the following courses
- Statistical Inference
- Regression Models
- Practical Machine Learning
- Developing Data Products
- Data Science Capstone

I only completed the courses marked with an asterisk.  As you can see, that means I was one course short of the Foundations certificate.  BUT I had too much of a gap between Exploratory Data Analysis and when I started Reproducible Research and would have needed to go back and re-learn my R.  So I didn't quite make it.

But what you see in this repository is what I completed in those first 4 courses.
