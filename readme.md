# Data Science projects
Here are a few projects I've put together

## A selection of R programming
These are artifacts coming from several courses that I took as part of the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) on Coursera by Johns Hopkins. See the [ReadMe](r-programming) in that folder for more information and samples.



## Projects from the [Python Project for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-science) 
From the IBM Data Science Certificate class.

## Projects from the [Python Project for Data Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-engineering/) 
From the IBM Data Engineering Certificate class.

It was a bit of an accident that I enrolled in this project.  I had intended to be enrolled in the Data Science specialization which is much more comprehensive, but was instead enrolled in the data engineering specialization.  Oddly enough, their 'project' classes are slightly different material even though they utilize basically the same Python.  I took this course first.
