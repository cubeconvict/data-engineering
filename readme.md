I also completed the [Python Project for Data Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-engineering/) course. ([Repo](https://github.com/cubeconvict/data-science/tree/main/IBM_data_engineering_project))

## Scraping a Boardgamegeek web page
I play a lot of boardgames and we frequently use https://boardgamegeek.com/ for information on our games.

One of my friends insists that he won't try games rated under 7.0 on bgg and so I set a little project for myself to scrape the site for a list of such games.

## My efforts to webscrape a googledocs list into a .csv
[Don't do it this way](parse.py)

[See my struggles](scrape_old.py)

[How you should do it](scrape.py)

## A selection of R programming
These are artifacts coming from several courses that I took as part of the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) on Coursera by Johns Hopkins. See the [ReadMe](r-programming) in that folder for more information and samples.
